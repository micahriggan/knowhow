This function allows an AI agent to check a file for coding errors or style issues (linting) based on the file's extension. It does this by:

1. Getting configuration settings.
2. Determining the file's extension.
3. Finding the appropriate linting command for that extension.
4. Running the linting command on the file.
5. Returning and logging the results of the linting process.

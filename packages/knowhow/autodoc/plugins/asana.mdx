# Asana Plugin Executive Summary

## Overview

The Asana Plugin is designed to enhance chat interactions by integrating Asana task and project data. It detects and resolves Asana task and project URLs within user prompts, retrieves relevant data, and embeds this information into the chat context. This plugin is particularly useful for teams and individuals who rely on Asana for project management and want to seamlessly incorporate task details into their communication workflows.

## Key Features

### Input Detection and Resolution

- **Task URLs**: The plugin identifies Asana task URLs within user prompts. It extracts these URLs and fetches the corresponding task details from Asana.
- **Project URLs**: Similarly, the plugin detects Asana project URLs and retrieves all tasks associated with the specified projects.

### Contextual Enhancements

- **Task Details**: For each detected task, the plugin generates a detailed string that includes the task name, description, URL, and completion status. This information is then embedded into the chat, providing users with immediate access to task specifics.
- **Project Tasks**: When project URLs are detected, the plugin fetches and embeds details for all tasks within the project, offering a comprehensive view of project progress and individual task statuses.

### Embeddings

- **Minimal Embeddings**: The plugin creates minimal embeddings for each task, which include:
  - **ID**: The unique URL of the task.
  - **Text**: A formatted string containing task details.
  - **Metadata**: JSON-encoded task data for additional context.

These embeddings can be used to enrich chat interactions, making it easier for users to reference and discuss specific tasks and projects.

## Environment Variables

To function correctly, the Asana Plugin requires the following environment variable to be set:

- **ASANA_TOKEN**: This token is used to authenticate API requests to Asana. It should be set to a valid Asana access token.

Example:
```bash
export ASANA_TOKEN=your_asana_access_token
```

## Usage

The Asana Plugin can be integrated into chat applications to provide real-time access to Asana task and project data. Users can simply include Asana task or project URLs in their messages, and the plugin will automatically fetch and embed the relevant details. This functionality is particularly useful for:

- **Project Management**: Keeping team members informed about task statuses and project progress.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitating discussions around specific tasks and projects by providing immediate access to detailed information.
- **Productivity**: Reducing the need to switch between chat applications and Asana, thereby streamlining workflows.

By leveraging the Asana Plugin, teams can enhance their communication efficiency and ensure that everyone stays on the same page with up-to-date task and project information.

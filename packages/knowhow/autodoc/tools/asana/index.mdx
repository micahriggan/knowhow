This function enables an AI agent to interact with Asana, a project management tool. Specifically, it allows the AI to:

1. **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks to a project.
2. **Update Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
3. **Search Tasks**: Find tasks based on a search term.
4. **Find Specific Tasks**: Retrieve details of a specific task by its ID.
5. **Get Subtasks**: List subtasks of a given task.
6. **Create Subtasks**: Add subtasks to an existing task.
7. **List My Tasks**: Retrieve tasks assigned to the AI's user.
8. **List Projects**: Get a list of all projects in the workspace.

This makes the AI capable of managing tasks and projects within Asana.

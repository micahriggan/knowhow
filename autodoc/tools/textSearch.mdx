This function allows an AI agent to search for a text term in two ways:

1. **Primary Method**: It uses a command-line tool (`ag`) to search for the term.
2. **Fallback Method**: If the tool isn't available, it searches through pre-configured text embeddings to find matches.

In simple terms, it helps the AI find information either using a fast tool or a backup method if the tool fails.

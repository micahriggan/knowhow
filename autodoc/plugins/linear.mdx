# Linear Plugin Executive Summary

## Overview

The Linear Plugin is designed to enhance chat interactions by detecting and resolving Linear issue URLs within user prompts. It provides additional context to chats by embedding detailed information about the referenced Linear issues. This plugin is particularly useful for teams using Linear for project management, as it allows seamless integration of issue tracking data into chat environments.

## Key Features

### Input Detection and Resolution

- **URL Extraction**: The plugin scans user prompts for Linear issue URLs. It uses a regex pattern to identify URLs that match the Linear issue format.
- **Issue Data Retrieval**: For each detected URL, the plugin fetches detailed information about the corresponding Linear issue, including its identifier, title, URL, and description.

### Contextual Enhancements

- **Issue Embedding**: The plugin generates embeddings for each detected Linear issue. These embeddings include:
  - **ID**: The URL of the issue.
  - **Text**: A formatted string containing the issue's identifier, title, URL, and description.
  - **Metadata**: Additional metadata (currently empty but can be extended).

### Embedding Generation

- **Minimal Embedding**: The plugin creates minimal embeddings that encapsulate essential information about each Linear issue. These embeddings can be used to enrich chat interactions with relevant issue details, making it easier for team members to discuss and resolve issues directly within the chat environment.

## Environment Variables

To function correctly, the Linear Plugin requires the following environment variable to be set:

- **LINEAR_API_KEY**: This API key is used to authenticate requests to the Linear API. Ensure that this environment variable is set with a valid Linear API key before using the plugin.

## Usage

The Linear Plugin can be integrated into chat applications to provide real-time issue tracking and context. When a user includes a Linear issue URL in their message, the plugin automatically detects the URL, retrieves the issue details, and embeds the information into the chat. This allows team members to quickly access and discuss relevant issue details without leaving the chat environment.

By leveraging the Linear Plugin, teams can improve their workflow efficiency, enhance communication, and maintain better visibility over their project management tasks directly within their chat applications.

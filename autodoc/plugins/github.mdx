# GitHub Plugin Executive Summary

## Overview

The GitHub Plugin is designed to enhance chat interactions by detecting and resolving GitHub pull request URLs within user prompts. It provides additional context by embedding detailed information about the changes in the pull requests. This plugin is particularly useful for teams and individuals who frequently discuss code changes and need quick access to the specifics of those changes.

## Key Features

### Input Detection and Resolution

- **Pull Request URL Detection**: The plugin scans user prompts for GitHub pull request URLs. It uses a regex pattern to identify URLs that match the format `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{pull_number}`.
- **Diff Retrieval**: Once a pull request URL is detected, the plugin retrieves the diff associated with that pull request. This includes all the changes made in the pull request, formatted as a diff.

### Contextual Enhancements

- **Parsed Diffs**: The plugin parses the diffs to filter out large changes, ensuring that only manageable and relevant changes are included. This helps in focusing on the most significant parts of the pull request.
- **Formatted Output**: The diffs are formatted in a readable manner, often in Markdown, making it easy to understand the changes directly within the chat interface.

### Embeddings

- **Minimal Embeddings**: The plugin generates minimal embeddings for the detected pull request URLs. Each embedding includes:
  - **ID**: The URL of the pull request.
  - **Text**: A JSON string representation of the parsed diff.
  - **Metadata**: Additional metadata, if any, associated with the diff.

## Environment Variables

To function correctly, the GitHub Plugin requires the following environment variable to be set:

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: This is a personal access token used to authenticate with the GitHub API. It must be set in the environment where the plugin is running. The token should have sufficient permissions to read pull request data from the repositories of interest.

## Usage

The GitHub Plugin can be used in various scenarios, including:

- **Code Reviews**: Automatically expand pull request URLs in chat to show the changes, facilitating quick reviews and discussions.
- **Team Collaboration**: Enhance team communication by providing immediate context about code changes without leaving the chat interface.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate summaries of pull request changes for reporting purposes or automated notifications.

By integrating this plugin, users can streamline their workflow, reduce context-switching, and improve the efficiency of code-related discussions.
